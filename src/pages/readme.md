# pages/

Houses **top-level pages** tied to application routes. This folder follows Next.js routing conventions.

## Guidelines
- Keep page-level logic here and delegate rendering to feature or component folders.
- Use dynamic routing (`[param].tsx`) where necessary.
- Add appropriate SEO metadata.
