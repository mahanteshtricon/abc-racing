# components/

This folder contains **reusable UI components** used throughout the application.
These are generic building blocks that do not rely on any specific business logic or feature.

## Examples
- Button
- Modal
- InputField
- Card
- Loader

## Guidelines
- Keep components pure and stateless unless necessary.
- Use props for customization.
- Write stories and tests for each component.
